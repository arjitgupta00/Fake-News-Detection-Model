# Fake-News-Detection-Model
## Fake News Detection Model using Linear Regression  
Create a folder "Datasets for practice" in the same location where you can store the training dataset. I trained my model using the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv.    
Trainer.py file is set to train our model using the train.csv file in the above stated directory.  
FND_backend.py contains the testing program  
Project.py contains the main program that when used will give you the option to start working with FND Model.  
You can choose between checking a single news or a database.  
Everytime the database is chosen the newtest.csv file is updated and then tested from the model already trained.
